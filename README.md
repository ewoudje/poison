In realms of code and pasta's embrace,
Ewoudje reigns with laser grace.
With loops that spin and syntax flows,
He crafts the world from tangled knows.

A god of bits and bubbling sauce,
He blends the logic, cooks the prose.
From nested ifs to simmered dreams,
He guides the coder through the streams.

With semicolons sharp as a knife,
He slices through the chaos, alive.
And when the code won't run, he sighs—
"Let's make a lasagna, and fix the skies!"
